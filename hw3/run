# Script for running X86Gen tests.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run tst/test01.java      -- test a single program 
#   ./run tst/test*.java       -- test all programs
#
# The script will show diffs between the generated .s file 
# and a reference version, and similarly for the output of the
# generated code. If it runs in silence, it means a perfect match.
# If there is no reference version, one is created for use next time.
